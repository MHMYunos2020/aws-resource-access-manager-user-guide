# Monitoring AWS RAM<a name="monitoring-overview"></a>

AWS RAM integrates with the following AWS services that offer monitoring and logging capabilities:
+ **Amazon CloudWatch Events**—Delivers a near\-real\-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources\. CloudWatch Events enables automated event\-driven computing, as you can write rules that watch for certain events and trigger automated actions in other AWS services when these events happen\. For more information, see [Monitoring with CloudWatch Events](using-cloudwatch-events.md)\.
+ **AWS CloudTrail**—Captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred\. For more information, see [Logging AWS RAM API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.
